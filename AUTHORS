peppy was written by Rob McMullen, starting in September of 2006.

I have borrowed code from other projects; see the file THANKS in this
directory.

In contrast to the code I have pulled from other projects and merged into
the project, other people have written code specifically for inclusion
into peppy.  Thanks to:

Julian Back
