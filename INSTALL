INSTALLATION
============

You do not need to install the program in any system directories in order to
use it.  For testing purposes, I recommend you just unpack the source and run
it from there.  See the README for more instructions.

If you do want to install in system directories, I recommend using setuptools,
the de-facto package management system in Python.  Setuptools provides a
program called easy_install that manages dependencies among packages.

You'll have to install wxPython separately, and if you don't have setuptools
you can bootstrap it using:

http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py

Once setuptools is installed, you are ready to install with:

$ tar xfv peppy-0.16.0.tar.bz2
$ cd peppy-0.16.0
$ easy_install -UZ .

INSTALLING OPTIONAL MODULES
===========================

If using the hyperspectral image viewing capabilities of peppy, numpy
*must* be installed, and scipy and gdal can optionally be installed.

Installing NumPy
----------------

The numerical python library, NumPy (numpy.scipi.org) is installed
like a typical python module: by downloading it and running

$ python setup.py install

You may have to be root to complete the installation.

Installing SciPy
----------------

SciPy is a bit more complicated of an install, as it depends on the
BLAS and LAPACK libraries.  The SciPy website has instructions here:

http://www.scipy.org/Installing_SciPy/BuildingGeneral

which is, unfortunately, a bit more complicated than just "python
setup.py install" but is relatively straight-forward.  In general, you
can just follow those instructions.

However, a problem that plagued me for a while was that the "python
setup.py install" stage was picking up libblas and liblapack from the
system's /usr/lib directory, and RedHat prior to early 2007 supplied
incomplete libraries.  I had to replace these system libraries with my
just-built libraries, because setup.py seemed to ignore the paths I
specified for BLAS and LAPACK as shown in the instructions on the
webpage above.

Installing GDAL
---------------

To take advantage of the variety of image formats that GDAL supports,
you can install it as well.  Download from www.gdal.org and uncompress
in a directory.  The setup is a bit more complicated than a typical
python module:

$ cd gdal-1.4.1
$ ./configure --without-python --with-ngpython
$ make
$ cd swig/python
$ python setup.py install
