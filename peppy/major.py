"""Base module for major mode implementations.

Implementing a new major mode means to extend from a wx Control and the
L{MajorMode} base mixin class.  Several attributes must be set: C{icon} that
points to the filename of the icon to be used, and C{keyword} which is a
text string that uniquely identifies the major mode from other major modes.
[FIXME: more documentation here.]

Once the major mode subclass has been created, it must be announced to
peppy.  This is done by returning the class from the peppy plugin method
L{IPeppyPlugin.getMajorModes} from an L{IPeppyPlugin} instance.  Plugins are
automatically loaded if they include a C{.peppy-plugin} companion file in
either the peppy/plugins directory of the source code or the plugins directory
in the user's peppy configuration directory.  Alternatively, plugins can be
installed directly in the python's site-packages directory using setuptools.
See more information in the L{IPeppyPlugin} documentation.

To provide menu items or toolbar items related to a major mode, you can
add actions using the L{SelectAction} class as a baseclass.

To provide context menu (i.e.  popup menus on a right mouse click) actions, use
the L{ContextMenu} interface to return L{SelectAction} classes in response to
the L{SelectAction.getPopupActions} method.

    """Mixin class for all major modes.
    
    Major modes are associated with some type (or types) of file, and
    provide a way to edit them.  Most major modes that edit text will
    actually want to be a subclass of L{FundamentalMode}, as that class
    uses the wx.stc.StyledTextControl as its base class and provides a
    lot of additional text editing support by default.  See L{PythonMode},
    L{ChangeLogMode}, and L{MakefileMode} for examples of modes that use
    L{FundamentalMode} as a basis.
    
    If a major mode isn't for a text file, however, it should use this
    mixin class along with some other subclass of wx.Window to provide the
    editing interface.  This mixin is required because it provides a lot of
    the boilerplate stuff that peppy needs to manage the major mode.  See
    L{HexEditMode} and L{DiredMode} for modes that don't use an stc for their
    user window.
    
    Associating the Major Mode with a File Type
    ===========================================
    
    When a file is opened, peppy uses the L{MajorModeMatcherDriver}
    class to determine which major mode to use to edit the file.  The
    L{MajorModeMatcherDriver.match} method loops over all major modes and
    uses the heuristics to determine the best match by calling the C{verify*}
    class methods of the major modes.  There are default implementations of
    the verify methods that use class attributes of the major mode to identify
    the mode.
    
    There are several ways to tell peppy to associate the major mode with
    a particular type of file.  
    
    MIME Type
    ---------
    
    The simplest is to specify the MIME type in the class attribute
    L{mimetype}.  The MIME type returned from the L{vfs.get_metadata}
    call will be used to match against the MIME type specified here; or
    alternatively you can override the L{verifyMimetype} class method and
    perform matching on the MIME type of each file as it's opened by peppy.
    
    However, not all MIME types are known by default to the VFS, so you may
    need to provide other ways to match the file.
    
    Filename
    --------
    
    If your file always has a certain extension, you can specify a
    regular expression is the L{regex} class attribute.  This uses the
    L{verifyFilename} method to return a match.  You can also override the
    L{verifyFilename} method directly.
    
    Note that only the filename is passed to the L{verifyFilename} method as
    it should be independent of the scheme used to retrieve the URL.  If you
    actually want to match on the scheme, use the L{verifyProtocol} method.
    
    Magic Bytes
    -----------
    
    If there's no easy way to tell the file type, you may need to check some
    bytes in the file to see if it matches some "magic number" that will
    identify the file that peppy is trying to load as one that your major
    mode supports.
    
    The class method L{verifyMagic} is called if there's no exact match by
    earlier methods.  In order to reduce the expense of this operation, a
    certain number of bytes (a minimum of 1024) are read from the file before
    the call to verifyMagic so that every major mode isn't trying to read the
    same file over and over.  If your file can't be uniquely determined in the
    first 1024 bytes, there is still a way to determine the file type: see the
    L{IPeppyPlugin.attemptOpen} method.
    
    Backend Storage
    ===============
    
    Once the major mode has been selected for that file, it is loaded into a
    L{Buffer} for storage.  There is only one Buffer instance per copy of a
    file that's loaded.  Multiple views of the same file always point back to
    the same Buffer.
    
    The major mode uses the Buffer as the backend storage for the data.  The
    Buffer uses a class that implements the L{STCInterface} as the actual
    storage space for the loaded file.  Major modes declare what type of
    L{STCInterface} is used for the backend storage by setting the class
    attribute L{stc_class}.
    
    Peppy is not limited to editing files that can fit in physical memory.
    However, the wx.stc.StyledTextCtrl (the Scintilla control, abbreviated
    'STC' here) does require that the file be held in physical memory.  So,
    if you're going to use an stc to display your file, you're limited to
    files that can fit in memory.  Files larger than physical memory should
    extend from L{NonResidentSTC}, but currently the extra steps required
    to make a major mode for extremely large files are not documented.  See
    L{hsi_major_mode} if you're interested, until better documentation is
    written.
    
    For a major mode that focuses on files that can be held in memory, the
    backend storage should be implemented by a L{PeppySTC} instance.
    
    STC Backend Storage and STC Used for Display
    --------------------------------------------
    
    If your major mode also uses an STC for displaying the text to the user,
    you should consider extending your major mode from L{FundamentalMode}, as
    the details will be taken care of for you.  But be aware that the STC used
    for backend storage is not the same as the STC presented to the user.
    
    The backend storage is the root document, and this root document does not
    get displayed.  The STC that is used for display will be linked to the
    Buffer's STC using the document pointer capability of Scintilla.  This
    means that multiple views of the same file are possible, and all share the
    same backend storage because they all point to the same buffer.
    
    STC Backend Storage without using an STC for Display
    ----------------------------------------------------
    
    It is also possible to use a real STC for backend storage, but use some
    different wx.Window subclass for display.  See the L{HexEditMode} for an
    example that uses a wx.Grid control to present the file as a string of
    binary bytes.
    
    There are complications to using this approach, however.  Because multiple
    views are possible, there could be a text view of a file at the same time
    as a hex edit view.  If both views were STCs, the changes in one would be
    automatically propagated to the other.  But, because one of the views is a
    wx.Grid, we must catch modification events and update the wx.Grid as bytes
    change in the other view.  See the L{HexEditMode} for more information.
    
    Fundamental Text Editing
    ========================
    
    Most major modes for text editing will use a real STC for user interaction.
    The best way to make a major mode that uses a real STC is to extend
    from L{FundamentalMode}.  Fundamental mode uses a bunch of mixins that
    extend the functionality of the STC, and provide the places for customized
    enhancements like brace highlighting, region commenting, paragraph
    finding, and a lot of other features.  Examining one of the subclasses of
    Fundamental mode is probably the best place to start if you're interested
    in extending peppy to handle a file that is currently unsupported.
