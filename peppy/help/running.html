<h1>Up and Running with Peppy</h1>
<p>Once peppy is <a class="reference external" href="/download.html">installed</a>, starting the application depends how you installed
the code.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Installed using easy_install: (RECOMMENDED)</dt>
<dd>If you used <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">easy_install</span></tt> to install the latest version from the Python
Package Index, a python script named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">peppy</span></tt> will be installed in the
system binary directory, so simply typing <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">peppy</span></tt> on the command line
will start the program.</dd>
<dt>Downloaded from source:</dt>
<dd>If you downloaded peppy but did not install the source, you run the
application with the command line <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">peppy.py</span></tt> from within the
peppy directory.</dd>
<dt>Installed from the downloaded source:</dt>
<dd>If you ran <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">setup.py</span> <span class="pre">install</span></tt> on the downloaded source, a python
script named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">peppy</span></tt> will be installed in the system binary directory.</dd>
<dt>Installed a binary distribution:</dt>
<dd>This is only applicable to Windows and Mac OS X. The install process will
leave an icon somewhere, and you can just click on that.</dd>
</dl>
<a name="command-line-use"></a>
<h2>Command Line Use</h2>
<p>When you start peppy from the command line, you can specify options and URLs
to load.  For example, running from a source distribution, you might use a
command line like this:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">peppy.py</span> <span class="pre">README</span> <span class="pre">/tmp/file.txt</span> <span class="pre">http://www.flipturn.org/index.html</span></tt></p>
<p>which tells peppy to open three URLs: the local file <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">README</span></tt> in the
current directory, the file <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/tmp/file.txt</span></tt>, and the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">index.html</span></tt> file from
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">http://www.flipturn.org</span></tt>.</p>
<a name="options"></a>
<h3>Options</h3>
<p>There are many command line options available, the most useful of which are
outlined below.  You can see the full list by running peppy with the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--help</span></tt>
argument.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>-d:</dt>
<dd>Send all debug printing to the console</dd>
<dt>-t:</dt>
<dd>Run in test mode &#8211; allow multiple peppy processes (see the next section)
and send all debug printing to the console</dd>
<dt>-v:</dt>
<dd>Run in verbose mode, which turns on <strong>a lot</strong> of debugging output.  Use in
combination with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-d</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-t</span></tt> to send the output to the console</dd>
</dl>


<a name="single-peppy-process"></a>
<h2>Single Peppy Process</h2>
<p>Normally, peppy only allows a single process per user so that subsequent file
open requests (by starting peppy from the command line with an argument) will
actually be opened by the already running process.  This can be disabled by
preference or by the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-t</span></tt> option as described above.</p>

<a name="using-the-basic-menu-functions"></a>
<h2>Using the Basic Menu Functions</h2>
<p>The GUI should be similar to typical windowed applications
on your platform.  The layout of the menu attempts to
follow the <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/XHIGMenus/chapter_17_section_4.html">Apple style guidelines for the menu bar</a>
even though peppy works with all platforms and not just Mac OS X. I found
their guidelines useful and logical, and so applied them to my work.</p>
<p>There are seven menu titles that will always appear in the menu bar, and
additional titles depending on the major mode.  The seven are: File, Edit,
View, Tools, Documents, Window, and Help.</p>
<p>The File menu contains the common file load, file save, and related options.
The Edit menu holds commands related to editing and selecting text or data,
and also is where you&#8217;ll find the <a class="reference external" href="preferences.html#preferences"><em>preferences</em></a>.  View
holds menu items that affect how the major mode displays its contents, but
nothing that actually alters the data &#8211; just how the data is viewed.  The
Tools menu holds standalone commands that either start a process or don&#8217;t
change the contents of the document.  The Documents menu contains a list of
currently open documents, but note that some documents may not have an active
view.  Window holds a list of top level peppy windows, allowing you to switch
back and forth between them.  And finally, Help contains menu items related
to documentation.</p>
<a name="opening-files"></a>
<h3>Opening Files</h3>
<p>Peppy provides several commands to open files, from the traditional GUI file
dialog using the File -&gt; Open -&gt; Open File menu command, to the more emacs-
like File -&gt; Open -&gt; Open File using Minibuffer command (bound to C-x C-f in
emacs keybinding mode).</p>

<a name="editing-files"></a>
<h3>Editing Files</h3>
<p>Once a file has been opened, a new tab will appear in the window that shows
the GUI that is used to edit that type of file.  There are specific types of
editing modes, called <a class="reference external" href="concepts.html#majormodes"><em>major modes</em></a>, for different types
of files.  For instance, plain text files are editing using the Fundamental
major mode, while python source files are edited using the Python major mode.
Both these major modes are similar is that they use a text editing component
(called the StyledTextCtrl in wxPython, which is based on the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scintilla.org">Scintilla</a>
source code editing component).  However, unlike most editors, text files
are not the only thing that can be edited.  There are major modes for editing
<a class="reference external" href="HexEdit.html#hexedit"><em>binary files</em></a>, and even <a class="reference external" href="HSI.html#hsi"><em>hyperspectral images</em></a>.</p>

<a name="saving-files"></a>
<h3>Saving Files</h3>
<p>After editing the file, it must be saved before the changes can be made
permanent.  Like opening files, there are several ways to save the file.
You can use the File -&gt; Save to save the file if you want to overwrite your
changes, or File -&gt; Save As to pull up a traditional file save dialog to save
it to a new file.  Some major modes provide other ways to save the file in the
File -&gt; Export menu.</p>
